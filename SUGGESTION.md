# Change Suggestion

## Rationale
Adding an open-source license like MIT clearly defines the terms under which others can use, modify, and distribute your software. This enhances the project's professionalism, encourages community contributions, and protects both the contributors and users by clarifying legal aspects. The MIT License is a popular choice due to its permissive nature and ease of understanding.

## Suggested Changes

**File to modify:** `README.md`

**Proposed change:**

Replace the placeholder `[Add your license information here]` in the `README.md` file with the following MIT License text:

```
MIT License

LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.
```

Alternatively, you could create a separate `LICENSE` file at the root of the repository with the above content and then update the `README.md` to reference it, for example: `This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.`

**Verification Steps:**
After applying the change, please ensure that the "License" section in your `README.md` file now clearly displays the MIT License text or a link to a dedicated `LICENSE` file.
